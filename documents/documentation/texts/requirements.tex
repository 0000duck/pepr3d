\chapter{System requirements and Installation}

In this chapter we will describe the system requirements of Pepr3D and the installation process.

\section{System requirements}

We divide the system requirements into \textbf{must have} items and recommended ones. The \textbf{must have} requirements are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a 64-bit CPU with SSE instructions
\item a GPU supporting OpenGL version 3.2
\end{enumerate}

These two requirements are mandatory and Pepr3D might not work if you do not meet one or both of these.

Now we mention recommended system parameters. These are derived from what the team has been developing the software on, since we do not have an access to any larger data.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{System:} Windows 8 / 10 (64-bit)
\item \textbf{Processor:} Dual core Intel CPU with clock speed 2.0 GHz or higher and 64-bit and SSE instructions
\item \textbf{Memory:} 2 GB or more
\item \textbf{GPU card:} GPU card compatible with OpenGL 3.2
\item \textbf{Storage:} 200 MB
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation}

Installing Pepr3D is very easy.
If you use the attached CD, you can run the executable files directly (see Appendix II).
Otherwise, a compressed archive can be downloaded\footnote{https://github.com/tomasiser/pepr3d/releases} and unpacked into a folder anywhere on your hard drive.
Pepr3D should now be ready to run.
